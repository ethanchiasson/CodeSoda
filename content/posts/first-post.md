## Prologue

---

When gods unchained was announced back in 2016, I was hyped for a new blockchain based card game. I’ll admit, I’m not the best card game player in the world, not even close, but I grew up collecting Yu Gi Oh and Pokémon cards and I have put my fair share of hours into games like Hearthstone and Legends of Runeterra, so I like to think I know what makes a good card game fun ( at least from the standpoint of the casual player ).

Gods unchained is a tactical/collectible card game that is built upon the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike traditional TCG/CCGs, God’s Unchained boast the fact that it’s cards are limited in number and live on the blockchain.

Gods unchained works by allowing a user to download a browser extension like MetaMask and use Ethereum to purchase card packs which offer various tiers of card rarities depending on the type of pack purchased.

These cards are limited in number and can be used along with the base set of 30 cards each user received for free. Packs generally cost anywhere from $5-$100 for the rarest packs, but can contain cards worth much more ( or much less ).

Since cards are limited in number, can’t be reproduced, and may have a specific place in the game Meta, digital marketplaces have helped drive up prices for some of the rarest cards. The card () was sold for over 175 ETH ( or $1200 ). That specific card probably isn’t worth $1200 when looking at the cards stats or it’s place in the game meta, but it’s **_true_** rarity makes the card desirable.

\$1200 for a card is a lot of money, and puts many Uber rare Pokémon cards to shame in terms of price ( Despite Pokemon cards having taken decades for card prices to reach their current levels ).

The major appeal to blockchain card games is that users are able to feel a sense of “tangibility” of their online assets, especially with rising issues of video games developers suspending accounts which hold items that may contain real world value.

Another interesting appeal of Gods Unchained ( and some other blockchain card games ) is that there is a place for investors and speculators who may not necessarily have the time or drive to actually play the game, but enjoy speculating on cards and making a profit in the markets for them.

Cards in God’s Unchained, like champions in MOBA games like League of Legends, are prone to changes in Meta, and thus, rarity alone isn’t the only factor that goes into pricing cards on an open market.

If this sounds familiar, that’s because Valve’s Card game Artifact allowed users to buy and and sell cards ( which are prone to buffs and nerds based on meta changes ) on the Steam market place, but the game didn’t end well ( although Valve is taking another shot at Artifact, but I will talk more about in a moment ).

## What is happening to Gods Unchained today?

---

Well, as of now, the game is in its Q3 Beta season and is currently ranked #52 in gaming according to dappradar.com. dapp.com list 10,000 unique active users, with only 3 active users within that last 24hrs, but it is hard to get an exact player count, as not all “active accounts” are actually playing the game and the exact player count is not publically available.

Still, for a non-AAA card game based on Ethereum, I was actually surprised to see the active players base for a beta was that large, assuming the numbers from these sources are true.

Nevertheless, the game is still seeing gameplay improvements and updates.

According to a a recent [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GodsUnchained/comments/hke5ym/state_of_the_beta_q3_2020/) titled "State of the Beta - Q3 2020" by ImmuteableClay, a God's Unchained Team Member...

> Our team has been working incredibly hard across the last quarter in order to make quality of life improvements to not just the game itself, but the wider Gods Unchained experience.
>
> In the last quarter, we saw some major improvements to the new player experience arrive in the form of the Welcome Set, a complementary set of 70 unique cards that allow users to customize their starter decks from the get-go. There’s more to come in this space, the next being new tutorial content (which is in the works internally).

The game was also recieved some much needed improvments to they marketplace.

> Marketplace improvements were high-up on our Q2 list to get out ahead of the expansion, especially in regards to making trinkets and boards tradable alongside cards – all of which is currently done, dusted, and running smoothly. We also announced Immutable X, which is going to greatly increase our functionality and scalability moving forward - a huge priority for us over the year ahead. Not only will this eliminate some of the problematic aspects around gas prices when it comes to fusing, trading and more, but it will also make it much easier to mint assets.

## Reasonings

---

Let’s break it down into 5 major points.

1. Ease of Use
2. Ethereum gas
3. Unoriginal Game Design
4. Lack of backing by Major Brands
5. Competition

### 1. Ease of Use

If you are reading this article, you probably already have some experience with digital assets, whether it be Bitcoin, Ethereum, or alt-coins. Unfortunately, crypto currency does have its barriers to entry.

Firstly, in order to be a paying customer on their platform ( meaning that you will purchase card packs in addition to using the free starter deck provided to all players ), you must first obtain the Ethereum to purchase the packs, which means you will most likely need to sign up with a Cryptocurrency exchange, which involves submitting KYC ( know your customer, or in other words, personal data such as a photo of your ID ). This is and will probably always be a problem for blockchain games. It’s hard to say that this system is perfect, when I know 12 year old me would have had a rough time even obtaining card packs today.

Of course these issues do not apply to everyone, and it is still possible to play the game without buying crypto card packs, but it surely defeats the purpose of the game if buying card packs is really that trivial and you are stuck using the base deck ( Yawn ).

I know that the game is geared towards crypto users, but if the game is really going to be successful it can’t rely on the small number of people who are dedicated enough to un-HODL their tokens on digital cards.

### 2. Ethereum gas = inconsistency

Let’s assume for a moment that you are already an established customer on an exchange like Coinbase, know how to use cryptocurrencies, and understand the ins and outs of the blockchain. Well, even then, there are metrics that are out of ones control that make purchasing card packs even hard.

Ethereum is a decentralized digital currency that can be sent to others around the world quickly, but to do so, one must spend Gas.

If you want to know more about the in and outs of Ethereum and how gas prices work, check out my friend Michael’s ( boxmining ) Video here:

**The TLDR is**, Depending on the current state of the network and gas prices, purchasing GU packs are prone to price increases.

Games like hearthstone offer packs to users for a set price ( usually around \$5 / pack ), unlike GU which prices their decks in Ethereum, meaning that one day, a deck may actually cost more than it did yesterday ( after calculating gas fees ).

Although this issue isn’t exclusive to God’s Unchained , it is still a major issue to overcome ( and another technical blockchain aspect you must educate your player base on ).

If gas prices became too high, what would that mean for the market? Not only the buying of cards from the developers be hit, but so will the user-to-user market.

### 3. Unoriginal Game Design = 🥱

If you have seen any beta gameplay of God’s Unchained, you’ll notice that it looks similar. I don’t mean “it looks like a card game”, I mean it looks ( and almost plays ) exactly like Blizzard’s flagship Hearthstone. It’s a hearthstone clone, but without the charm of the Blizzard Universe.

I am not totally sure why the developers lacked bringing anything new ( at least noticeable ) to the table, but I have my suspicions.

It is possible that the reason GU comes off as unoriginal ( in terms of gameplay concepts ), because it is and the developers felt like it has to be.

The issue with blockchain card games and new card games in general is education. It’s hard enough to get players educated on the idea of blockchain card games, and I feel like GU attempted to develop something that was recognizable enough , but not different enough to say “wait, how do I play this game?”. If you ever played hearthstone, you wouldn’t even really need to go through a tutorial, because at first glance you already feel like you know what to do ( which is both a good and bad thing ).

I do believe there were other reasons to this decision, including trying to win over popular hearthstone players in an attempt to bring their following base to the game and even simply the fact that developing a interesting card game while making it playable in a competitive circuit is very difficult.

I am not in the minds of the developers, and these are only my guesses, but it’s no secret that GU and Zombie Battle Grounds are hearthstone clones at their core, which is disappointing coming from a game that is trying to be “innovative”.

### 4. Lack of backing by Major Brands

Yes, I did mention that Coinbase ( one of the most popular crypto exchanges ) backed GU and the developers did raised over \$15,000,000 in their pack pre-sale, but let me explain what I mean by “backing”.

Take Gwent, Hearthstone, Elder Scroll Legends, Artifact, for example. What do these games all have in common? Yes, they are all spinoffs of popular and lore rich video games or series, which is a huge advantage when launching a game in a market as competitive as cards.

Blockchain card games have the distinct disadvantage that large brands have a hard time excepting, which is, blockchain is decentralized, and there is no reason why companies like Blizzard would want to eat at their profits by limiting card printings. Why would Blizzard , Activision, or Bethesda ever make a Blockchain card game, using their popular brands, when they can make more money with a centralized system.

It’s also important to point out that large brands might not like the idea of using blockchain for other reasons, such as rollback issues, harder to control, increased cost of hiring blockchain experts, negative perceptions of cryptocurrencies, etc, so my reasonings and guesses are as good as the next persons.

### 5. Competing with the big guys is almost impossible

Building off of point 4, a huge issue with entering a space like this is competing with larger game corporations.

For example, it’s hard to deny that an important part of developing a lasting and popular digital card game is having a strong Streamer presence and a well funded tournament circuit, both of which are very hard for smaller start-ups and very easy for large companies with existing millions of fans world wide.

For example, because large brands have an existing fan base they are almost guaranteed that a small portion their fans will play their spinoff card games. One of the best examples is GWENT. GWENT is a good card game on its own, but do you really think it would have seen as much success as it did if it did not have the Witcher Lore? Of course not. In fact, the only major card game I can think of that has seen success without a major existing brand is MTG, but that is a very rare case of the perfect storm, something that hasn’t happened in the CCG/TCG space since.

However, I am not saying that God's Unchained ( in particular ) won't be able to provide a strong esports scene. In fact, the same reddit post mentioned earlier in the article sheds some light on the current state of competitive Tounrament play.

> One of the other questions that we commonly receive is around the World Championship and our plans in that area. This is something that we’ve been actively working on internally, but have had to refactor much of our initial thinking around this in light of global travel bans and other limitations to large-scale physical events. It’s looking likely that this will need to move to an online format, but we’ll expand on this in the future with more of the details ironed out. You’ll still need a Tournament Pass in order to enter. The prize pool is currently sitting around the \$570,000 mark, and we’re aiming to have the prizes spread more deeply amongst competitors and not just concentrated on the top spots alone. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done to accomplish this on the scale that we require with up to 20,000 potential entrants, but we can’t wait to share more with you in the future.
>
> One of the requisites that we need for the World Championship is the ‘Direct Challenge’ feature, otherwise known as 1v1. We’ve shared previously that production has commenced in this area, and we’re currently aiming for it to land in players’ hands shortly after the launch of Trial of the Gods. The team can’t wait to see what kinds of events you all come up with!

## Conclusion

With all of this said, I want it to be clear that I am **not** against the idea of blockchain based card games. In fact, I would love to see a blockchain card game succeed on a mainstream level, and maybe God’s Unchained will make use of their \$15,000,000 in presales and strong development team to to make that happen, but competing against big names like Blizzard will be a huge challenge.

Blockchain is new and growing. New blockchain games are launching each day and have changed the way we perceive gaming. Startups like Stardust.gg have begun offering tools to help game developers easily implement blockchain assets into their games, and hopefully companies like this and the leap of faith games like God’s Unchained have taken will help make blockchain gaming a reality.
